    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I am a graduate of Geography (Meteorology) from Federal University of Technology, Minna. I am currently in my youth service year. I picked up interest in coding during my final year project work, which was on "effect of rainfall effectiveness on maize yield in Kafanchan Local government area of Kaduna state". I really wanted to develop an app that had a database of maize production for the previous years and recent technologies used around the wold in boosting productivity. But for the fact that i couldnt code had to subject my work to something else entirely. It been a beautiful experience so far learning to code, thanks to Capacitybay and the wonderful faculties who take out time to put this event together. I am extremely grateful.</p>
